title: By clinicians, for clinicians
description: >
  We are a mix of clinicians, developers, and clinician-developers who were fed up with the state of technology in healthcare.
  <br>
  <br>
  The push towards implementing electronic health records has led to a system where a single shift can average <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24060331" target="_blank">4,000 clicks</a>. This has led to technology built "for billing" rather than "for health," and it's causing <a href="https://khn.org/news/death-by-a-thousand-clicks/" target="_blank">an epidemic of burnout</a> among providers. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Thankfully, the technology landscape has changed. We now have the ability to take these designs into our own hands.
