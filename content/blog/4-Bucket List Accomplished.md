## Intro -

My First Meta Blog - 

This has been a challenge to get to this point, and hopefully I haven't corrupted the entire website, but here is my first post.  This is really more
of a test of my ability in GIT to make the changes from my fork and create a pull request to upate the changes.  Sounds easy, right?  Not so much...  after 
watching the intro video, I knew I was in for a challenge because I didn't understand alot of the terminology or have a 'favorite code editor'.  I didn't 
have any code editor and realized I would have to install Linux on my Chromeboox to get a 'favorite' code editor VS Code.

Easier said then done... my computer didn't have enough memory, so needed to delete a bunch of files.  Realizing that my computer is not really ideal 
for this.  Thinking I will need to upgrade my trusty Chromebook to something with a little more memory.

After watching John's video 50 times, I was almost getting it, and have gotten to the point of making the change and attempting to push it back.  If you are reading this, then somehome I guess it was successful.  Hopefully the learning curve is pretty steep here, so future posts won't take me 10+ hours to create!

Cheers!
