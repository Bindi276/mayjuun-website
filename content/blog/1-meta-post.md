# Welcome to the Informatics Meta-Blog

Knowledge is power...and best shared with others. This is the place where any informatician, innovator, or entrepreneur can crowd-source contribute and build upon each others' knowledge.

Many of the things I post here will be open-source and moderately technical, but that's only my preference. If there's something else you want to share about healthcare, informatics, innovation, or entrepreneurship, please feel free. Just don't use this as a shameless plug for your work. I won't accept those submissions.

By the end of this post, you'll learn:

1. how to contribute to this meta-blog
2. how to make an open-source website

## Why So Meta

There's a reason why this is called a 'meta-blog'. The term [meta] is Greek for 'after' or 'beyond', but the true beauty of this word is its implied transcendence. Take the following:

1. meta-data == data about data
2. meta-analysis == analysis of multiple analyses
3. meta-cognition == thinking about thought

Put simply, if you are shifting focucs from the topic at hand to the factors that surround it, then that's meta. _(Incidentally, breaking the fourth wall counts as [meta-theatrical])._

It's fun to be meta on occasion. Even [The Adventure Zone] -- a tabletop / D&D podcast -- will occasionally host a 'meta-episode', where they discuss the overarching story and path without fiction and answer questions from fans. BTW, these meta-episodes have excellent titles: [The The Adventure Zone Zone]

## Clinical Informatics: A 'Meta-Specialty'

The Clinical Informatics Subspecialty (CIS) expands into all areas of healthcare. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) [defines CIS] as "the subspecialty of all medical specialties that transforms healthcare." I believe Clinical Informatics is a meta-specialty...not a subspecialty. We all have so many strengths/passions/interests, clinical backgrounds, and career paths that it can be difficult to characterize succinctly. [KOI Pond] sought to do this, but even that has its drawbacks.

## The Meta-Blog

Now with all of that out of the way, let me show you how to contribute to this blog and how to make a website.

## Contributing to This Blog

Anyone can make a static website these days, and if you build upon open-source, the path forward can be very rewarding. I\'m using the open-source static site generator called [Hugo], implemented with a [custom open-source theme] ([+ my own mods]).

If you've never worked with GitHub Pull Requests, start by watching this 2 minute video:
{{< youtube 8lGpZkjnkt4 >}}

The entire website exists as two Github repos:

1. the repo where I make all changes: [mayjuun-website]  <--- *fork this repo!!!*
2. an auto-updated repo that makes a [GitHub page]

On my end, I make changes to repo #2 via two convenience scripts ([update], [deploy]) to automate my Git commands. All I have to do is open a terminal and type:

```terminal
./update.sh
./deploy.sh
```

...and I'm done. Website is accurate, with all changes implemented and tracked by Git.

## Creating a Post

If you haven't yet, fork my [mayjuun-website] repo.
{{< figure src="/images/blog/1-meta/fork-repo.png" width="600" >}}

Go to the new fork you just created, and clone it to your desktop.

{{< figure src="/images/blog/1-meta/clone-repo.png" width="600" >}}

In terminal, in that folder, create a [new branch], and make whatever edits you want in your favorite IDE, such as [VS Code].

With everything set-up as is, I just need to create a new Markdown file in my blog directory `/content/blog/##-MY-POST.md`. Usually, I'll just copy the previous post, update the tags/images, and delete all the text. I'll typically put images in the `/static/images/blog/##/` folder, to keep things organized. Finally, if you have Hugo installed, you can run `hugo serve -D` in terminal to see your changes implemented each time you save a file.

The [Markdown Cheat Sheet] is a handy resource for Markdown formatting. Feel free to look at my other `.md` blog posts in this repo for formatting tips. Keeping with the open-source theme, consider using [Pexels], [Unsplash], or [Pixabay] when choosing stock images. Finally, if you need an image with custom sizing, use this snippet with `img-right` or `img-left` based on intended alignment and with your custom `width`:

```hugo
{{</* figure src="/images/blog/YOUR_IMAGE.PNG" title="YOUR TITLE" class="img-right" width="250" */>}}
```

Here's an example of what a Markdown file looks like
{{< figure src="/images/blog/1-meta/vs-code.png" width="600" >}}

## Submitting a Post

When you're done editing, open a terminal in the repo's main folder and type:

```terminal
hugo-touch.py content/blog/##-MY-POST.md
```

This runs [a simple python script] to update the `date:` timestamp at the top of the file. This timestamp represents the time a post has been finalized and is used to sort blog posts.

Finally, add and commit your changes. You can use the command line, such as was shown in the above YouTube video:

```terminal
git add .
git commit -m "CATCHY COMMIT TITLE ðŸ˜Ž"
git push origin MY-BRANCH-NAME
```

...or you can use [VS Code directly], which is my preference. You'll want to make a pull request on my repo so that I can implement your changes, which is covered in both the [YouTube video] and on [this site].

### Creating a Website

If you want to make your own website, follow these steps:

1. Install Hugo. I'd suggest using [their steps] based on your operating system. For Mac, you need [Homebrew] first if you don't already have it. To install Homebrew, open a terminal and type:

```terminal
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
```

2. Then use Homebrew to install Hugo:

```terminal
brew install hugo
```

3. And verify you have hugo installed:

```terminal
hugo version
```

4. You can use Finder/Explorer or you can use [basic terminal commands] to decide where you want to put your website folder on your machine. For example, if you want a website called `quickstart` in a new folder called `~/dev` on Mac/Linux, type:

```terminal
mkdir ~/dev
```

5. Then navigate to that folder:

```terminal
cd ~/dev
```

6. And use Hugo create a brand new site:

```terminal
hugo new site quickstart
```

7. Finally, run a local server with the command line:

```terminal
hugo serve -D
```

This will run your site in fast render mode (which is the `-D` flag). You can access this site when the serve is running by going to `https://localhost:1313` in your preferred web browser. If you ran this same command `hugo serve -D` in another folder, such as where you forked/cloned my [mayjuun-website] repo, then you can run a local version of that website instead. As you make changes to the site locally, the browser will automatically update each time a file is saved.

Finally, you can close your server by pressing `ctrl + c` in the terminal. That's it! You now have a static site!

Let me know if you want me to cover other content about static sites. Next post, I'll plan to cover some [Flutter]-related content.
